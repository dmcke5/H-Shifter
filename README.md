I got sick of using the flappy paddles on my Logitech wheel so I decided to build my own H-Pattern and sequential shifter! All parts can be 3D printed!

I've included all the files in both STEP and STL format. If you decide to have the internals made in Aluminium like I did in the video, use the "Bearing Mount Alloy.STEP" file instead of the "Printed Bearing Block.STL".

You will also need to purchase the following parts:

If printing, you will also need:
16x M3x5x5 Threaded Inserts
2x M3x4x5 Threaded Inserts

You'll also need a variety of M3 screws, nuts and washers along with a couple of M5 washers for spacing out the bearings as shown in the video.

####Electronics and Software

Wire the potentiometer output to A3, and the switches to D2 and D3.
